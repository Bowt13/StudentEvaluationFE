#### Goal:
The goal of this assignment to create an app where a teacher can create classes,
students and grade the students.

#### Things I liked:
I really liked thinking about the design of the page and what needs to go where
to have a certain flow. Also I liked thinking about the data-model. To be honnest
I just like solving giant puzzles.

#### Things I didn't like:
The final evaluation of the assignment itself stressed me out quite a bit. But I
made it.

#### Things I've learned:

- Being self-sufficient.
